\section{CONCLUSION}

In this research study we see a case study of how we can use Theory of Argumentation to underline legal disputes regarding marine insurance policies arising from disagreements on the proximate cause of loss.  We use argumentation theory to see how the law is interpreted and propose a model of the insurance contract and relevant laws used in the case and evaluate the model using logic programming.
