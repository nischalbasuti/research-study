\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}

Common law is a legal system where the source for judicial decisions are the decisions made by judges in previous cases.
In addition to this, there are legislatures which are used to pass new statutes and laws.
There can be complex relationships between court decisions and the statutes. Some jurisdictions overrule the judicial decisions with the statutes, or codify the topic covered by various ambiguous and contradicting rulings.
In other jurisdictions, judicial decisions decide whether the constitution allows a statute or statutory provision to be made and what the statutory provision means.
Among many countries, United States of America is one which follows Common law.

It is necessary to understand logical structure of court cases that give rise to a particular law to understand the logical structure of a common law system.

\section{Problem Statement}

Common law is the type of law in which the law is derived from the conclusions of previous similar
kinds of cases and tribunals. In order to understand the logical structure of these laws the only way
is to understand the logical structure of similar kind of cases one by one. One way which might
help in understanding the logical structure of the legal disputes and how they come to a conclusion
is by applying argumentation theory. Therefore, the problem considered in this study is to find a
way in which Argumentation theory can be used to underline the legal disputes of a
particular case.

\section{Objectives}

% Application of argumentation theory to fit the legal arguments into formal arguments in a typical
% financial legal dispute cases of U.S., one legal case at a time, in order to analyze and understand the
% logical structure of the case, the conclusions supported by the case and how the case is resolved.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyzing court cases related to marine insurance where the primary dispute is about proximate cause of loss
    \item and modeling the legal arguments in said court cases as formal arguments and applying argumentation theory to understand the logical structure and judgments passed out on each case.
\end{enumerate}
  

\section{Limitations and Scope}

The legal case taken as case study is from marine insurance legal disputes in the United States of America. This study covers the legal disputes which arise due to disagreements on the proximate cause of loss.
